months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]


# 1. Ask the user to input the number 1, 2, 3, or 4, 
# then use "if" and related statements to display the months of 
# the corresponding quarter. If the user inputs an invalid value,
# let them know. Use ranges to retrieve sets of months.
# Remember that $stdin.gets.chomp retrieves a string value.








puts "\n--------------------" # line to distinguish exercise output


# 2. Ask the user to input a degree value from 0 to 360. 
# Assuming 0/360 is North, use "case" and "when" to output whether 
# the degrees point Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, or Northwest. 
# Remember that $stdin.gets.chomp retrieves a string value.
